The code within this repository was used for my 2nd and 3rd year projects. 

An Arduino Alarm System was completed as part of second year. 

Two sketches were used to complete the IoT Weather Station which was completed as my final year project. Labelled Arduino and Node. 

The reasoning behind having two sketches was due to the fact the Node MCU didn't include enough ports for sensors etc. 
The sensors were connected to the Arduino and the data collected was sent to the Node MCU through serial communication.
The data was then sent to the cloud using the Node MCU's wifi module.
